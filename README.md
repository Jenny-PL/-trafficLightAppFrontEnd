# Traffic Light App (front end)

## Problem solved:  
- Many young kids (mine, specifically) can't tell time.  This app will allow them to know when they can get up in the morning (and let me sleep in longer).
- Additionally, older kids or adults who can't tell time may find a visual alarm helpful

## In production:
- The option to add music to wake up, by uploading a song
- Heroku deployment
- Conversion to progressive web app

## Technology used:
- Typescript (front end) with React
- Python with Flask (backend), with a MongoDB database (To store music. See 'in production')
- See trafficLightAppBackEnd repo
