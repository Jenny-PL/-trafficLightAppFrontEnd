# Traffic Light App (front end)

## Problem solved:  
- Many young kids (mine, specifically) can't tell time.  This app will allow them to know when they can get up in the morning (and let me sleep in longer).  We have a clock that does this at home, but it's rather bulky, so I'd like an app that we can pull up on a tablet to use if we're on vacation
- Additionally, older kids or adults who can't tell time may find a visual alarm helpful
- The circular progress bar gives a visual of how much time is left, relative to when the alarm was set.

## In production:
- The option to add music to wake up, by uploading a song
- Make it a progressive web app

## Technology used:
- Typescript (front end) with React
- Heroku deployment, to make it available online
- Python with Flask (backend), with a MongoDB database (To store music. See 'in production')
- See trafficLightAppBackEnd repo
